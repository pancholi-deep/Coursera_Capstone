# Coursera_Capstone
Repository for the Capstone Project of IBM Data Science Certification

This Repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks that I created while doing the Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Certification.

1. Introduction:
This notebook was created for practicing GitHub repository.

2. Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto:
In this assignment, you will be required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so you need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You can decide to work with only boroughs that contain the word Toronto and then replicate the same analysis we did to the New York City data. It is up to you.

Just make sure:
to add enough Markdown cells to explain what you decided to do and to report any observations you make.
to generate maps to visualize your neighborhoods and how they cluster together.
